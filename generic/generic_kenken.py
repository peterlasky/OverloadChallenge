        ### Build overlap dictionary
        '''
        'overlap' maps overlapping cage pairs to their overlapping position. 
        
        For a crossword, any two Variables (cages) can overlap once or not at all. 
        overlap(v1, v2) returns [] or a pair (i,j), meaning the i_th cell of v1 is
        identical to the j_th cell of v2.  

        For Kenken, an overlap(cage1, cage2)= (i,j) means the i_th cell of cage1 shares a
        row or column with the j_th cell.  But there can be multiple overlaps. Here,
        overlaps returns a list of (i,j) overlaps.

        Here, we wrap the output in a custom class, Overlap. See write-up for details
